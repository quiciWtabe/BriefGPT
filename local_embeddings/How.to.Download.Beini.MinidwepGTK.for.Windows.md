If you want to download Beini Minidwep-GTK for Windows, you have two options. You can either download the Xiaopan OS, which is a fork of Beini that is compatible with Windows, Mac and Linux, or you can download the Beini ISO file and run it in a virtual machine (VM) environment.
 
## Option 1: Download Xiaopan OS
 
Xiaopan OS is an easy to use software package that includes Minidwep-GTK and other tools such as Inflator, Reaver, Feeding Bottle and Wifite. It is based on the Tiny Core Linux (TCL) operating system and has a slick graphical user interface. You can install and boot Xiaopan OS through a USB pen drive or in a VM environment.
 
To download Xiaopan OS, you can visit the official website at [^1^] or go to the SourceForge page at [^2^]. The latest version as of April 2023 is 6.4.1 and it has a size of 70 MB. You can check the MD5 checksum to verify the integrity of the file.
 
Once you have downloaded Xiaopan OS, you can either burn it to a CD or use a tool like Yumi Boot or LiLi USB Creator to create a bootable USB drive. Then you can boot your computer from the CD or USB and run Xiaopan OS live. Alternatively, you can use a VM software like Parallels Desktop, VMware or VirtualBox to create a virtual machine and load Xiaopan OS as an ISO image.
 
## Option 2: Download Beini ISO file
 
If you prefer to use the original Beini operating system, you can download the Beini ISO file from [^3^]. The latest version as of April 2023 is 1.2.5 and it has a size of 63 MB. You can also check the MD5 checksum to verify the integrity of the file.
 
After downloading Beini ISO file, you can either burn it to a CD or use a tool like Rufus or UNetbootin to create a bootable USB drive. Then you can boot your computer from the CD or USB and run Beini live. Alternatively, you can use a VM software like VirtualBox or VMware Player to create a virtual machine and load Beini as an ISO image.
 
## How to use Minidwep-GTK
 
Once you have booted into Xiaopan OS or Beini, you can launch Minidwep-GTK from the desktop or the menu. Minidwep-GTK will scan for available wireless networks and display them in a list. You can select the network that you want to attack and click on "Launch" to start the cracking process.
 
Minidwep-GTK will use different methods to crack the wireless network password, such as dictionary attack, brute force attack or WPS attack. Depending on the security level and complexity of the password, this may take some time. Once Minidwep-GTK finds the password, it will show it in a pop-up window.
 
You can also use Minidwep-GTK to capture handshake packets, inject packets, deauthenticate clients or perform other wireless attacks. For more details on how to use Minidwep-GTK, you can refer to the documents folder in Xiaopan OS or visit some online tutorials and forums.
 
## Conclusion
 
Beini Minidwep-GTK is a powerful tool for wireless security testing and hacking. You can download it for Windows either as part of Xiaopan OS or as an ISO file and run it live or in a VM environment. However, you should use it responsibly and ethically, and only on networks that you own or have permission
